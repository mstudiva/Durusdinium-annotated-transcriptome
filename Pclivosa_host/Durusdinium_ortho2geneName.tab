OG0001173	Interferon-inducible iron-sulfur (4FE-4S) cluster- binding antiviral protein which plays a major role in the cell antiviral state induced by type I and type II interferon. Can inhibit a wide range of viruses, including west Nile virus (WNV), dengue virus, sindbis virus, influenza A virus, sendai virus and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Displays antiviral activity against influenza A virus by inhibiting the budding of the virus from the plasma membrane by disturbing the lipid rafts. This is accomplished, at least in part, through binding and inhibition of the enzyme farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS), which is essential for the biosynthesis of isoprenoid-derived lipids. Promotes TLR7 and TLR9-dependent production of IFN-beta production in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) by facilitating Lys-63'- linked ubiquitination of IRAK1. Plays a role in CD4 T-cell activation and differentiation. Facilitates T-cell receptor (TCR)- mediated GATA3 activation and optimal T-helper 2 (Th2) cytokine production by modulating NFKB1 and JUNB activities. Can inhibit secretion of soluble proteins (By similarity)
