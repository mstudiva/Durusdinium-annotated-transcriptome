OG0000863	Voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) mediate the entry of calcium ions into excitable cells and are also involved in a variety of calcium-dependent processes, including muscle contraction, hormone or neurotransmitter release, gene expression, cell motility, cell division and cell death. This channel gives rise to T-type calcium currents. T-type calcium channels belong to the low-voltage activated (LVA) group and are strongly blocked by nickel and mibefradil. A particularity of this type of channels is an opening at quite negative potentials, and a voltage- dependent inactivation. T-type channels serve pacemaking functions in both central neurons and cardiac nodal cells and support calcium signaling in secretory cells and vascular smooth muscle. They may also be involved in the modulation of firing patterns of neurons which is important for information processing as well as in cell growth processes

OG0000961	Interferon-inducible iron-sulfur (4FE-4S) cluster- binding antiviral protein which plays a major role in the cell antiviral state induced by type I and type II interferon. Can inhibit a wide range of viruses, including west Nile virus (WNV), dengue virus, sindbis virus, influenza A virus, sendai virus and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Displays antiviral activity against influenza A virus by inhibiting the budding of the virus from the plasma membrane by disturbing the lipid rafts. This is accomplished, at least in part, through binding and inhibition of the enzyme farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS), which is essential for the biosynthesis of isoprenoid-derived lipids. Promotes TLR7 and TLR9-dependent production of IFN-beta production in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) by facilitating Lys-63'- linked ubiquitination of IRAK1. Plays a role in CD4 T-cell activation and differentiation. Facilitates T-cell receptor (TCR)- mediated GATA3 activation and optimal T-helper 2 (Th2) cytokine production by modulating NFKB1 and JUNB activities. Can inhibit secretion of soluble proteins (By similarity)
